# 14.0.0    Introduction to {{group}}s

> A {{group}} is a collection of {{people}}. You can create different types of {{group}}s: automatic, manual or merge. 

A {{group}} is a collection of {{people}} or organisations. You can set up any number of {{group}}s, and each {{person}} can belong to lots of {{group}}s. For example, you may set up the following {{group}}s:

  * steering {{group}} members
  * {{user}}s in N1
  * new {{user}}s in Q2 and Q3 2013
  * all youth {{work}} {{staff}}
  * organisations working with children

You can use {{group}}s in different ways:

  * bulk data entry. Perhaps you have a regular {{group}} of {{user}}s that come to every session. Instead of adding them individually each time, create a {{group}}, and enter the name of the {{group}} in your {{work}} record. {{Lamplight}} will add everyone that's in the {{group}} to the {{work}} record (see section [9.1.2  Adding attendance details to a {{work}} record](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/9.1.2) ). You can do the same for {{outcome}}s and {{comm}}s.
  * {{Report}} filters. Rather than running {{report}}s for everyone on the system, {{group}}s can be used to limit the data included in the {{report}} (see section [17.1.1  {{Report}} filters](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/17.1.1) ).
  * {{Group}} data views. You can use {{group}}s to view various pieces of information about different {{people}} at once (see section [14.8.0  {{Group}} data views](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/14.8.0) ).

There are three types of {{group}}s: {{manual group}}s, {{auto group}}s, and {{merge group}}s. 
  * {{Manual group}}s are created by selecting names from a list. Similar to a written list of names, the {{group}} won't change unless someone manually updates the list.
  * {{Auto group}}s are like saved searches: you enter the criteria (e.g. 'postcode starts with N1') and {{Lamplight}} searches for everyone that meets those criteria. Each time you use the {{group}}, {{Lamplight}} will automatically check again: so if someone moves out of the area and you update the postcode, that person will no longer be in the {{group}}, without you having to change anything else. 
  * {{Merge group}}s are composed of existing {{auto group}}s or {{manual group}}s - {{Lamplight}} will take all the members of each of the {{group}}s you specify and combine them into one, removing any duplicates.
